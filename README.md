# Commentative
Add your thoughts when sharing content.

Live here: https://commentative.herokuapp.com/

## How it works
Paste a URL, add some comments, share the URL so others can add their comments.

* When a user pastes in a URL, Commentative pulls the linked article. Then the user can add their thoughts to specific paragraphs. 
* It generates a unique URL to that marked up page. 
* Anyone with that unique URL can add and remove thoughts on the page.

## Aims
Commentative came out of a discussion about how people  interact when they want to share content, and share their thoughts about that content. 

Commentative aims to help those interactions by doing three things differently:
* **Frictionless:** We're trying to help people have a conversation. Logging in, installing plugins, dismissing pop-ups don't.
* **Open:** People don't limit their conversations about content to specific websites or content types. 
* **Friendly:** A URL is shared between people who already know each other. So no infectious toxicity.
