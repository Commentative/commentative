# Commentative
Add your thoughts when sharing content.

Live here: https://commentative.herokuapp.com/



## How it works
Commentative pulls an article then allows a user to add their thoughts on it. It generates a unique URL to that marked up page which can be shared with anyone.

## Made at HackThePress
This project was made at the [HackThePress 2019 Hackathon](https://www.hackthepress.org/2019-hackathon/) in London.
